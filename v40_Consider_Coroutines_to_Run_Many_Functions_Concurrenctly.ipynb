    "have for the next clock tick. Finally, it yields a Transition object to tell the\n",
    "environment the cell’s next state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex 10\n",
    "Importantly, the call to count_neighbors uses the yield from expression. This\n",

    "reuse smaller pieces of functionality and build complex coroutines from simpler ones.\n",
    "When count_neighbors is exhausted, the final value it returns (with the return\n",
