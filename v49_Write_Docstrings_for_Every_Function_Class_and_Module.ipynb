    "Docstrings can be attached to functions, classes, and modules. This connection is part of\n",
    "the process of compiling and running a Python program. Support for docstrings and the\n",
    "__doc__ attribute has three consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The accessibility of documentation makes interactive development easier. You can inspect functions, classes, and modules to see their documentation by using the help built-in function. This makes the Python interactive interpreter (the Python “shell”) and tools like IPython Notebook (http://ipython.org) a joy to use while you’re developing algorithms, testing APIs, and writing code snippets.\n",
    " - A standard way of defining documentation makes it easy to build tools that convert the text into more appealing formats (like HTML). This has led to excellent documentation-generation tools for the Python community, such as Sphinx (http://sphinx-doc.org). It’s also enabled community-funded sites like Read the Docs (https://readthedocs.org) that provide free hosting of beautiful-looking documentation for open source Python projects.\n",
    " - Python’s first-class, accessible, and good-looking documentation encourages people to write more documentation. The members of the Python community have a strong belief in the importance of documentation. There’s an assumption that “good code” also means well-documented code. This means that you can expect most open source Python libraries to have decent documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To participate in this excellent culture of documentation, you need to follow a few\n",
    "guidelines when you write docstrings. The full details are discussed online in PEP 257\n",
    "(http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). There are a few best-practices you should be\n",
