    "When debugging a Python program, the print function (or output via the logging\n",
    "built-in module) will get you surprisingly far. Python internals are often easy to access via\n",
    "plain attributes (see Item 27: “Prefer Public Attributes Over Private Ones”). All you need\n",
    "to do is print how the state of your program changes while it runs and see where it goes\n",
    "wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex 1\n",
    "The print function outputs a human-readable string version of whatever you supply it.\n",
    "For example, printing a basic string will print the contents of the string without the\n",
    "surrounding quote characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex 2\n",
    "This is equivalent to using the '%s' format string and the % operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex 3\n",
    "The problem is that the human-readable string for a value doesn’t make it clear what the\n",
    "actual type of the value is. For example, notice how in the default output of print you\n",
    "can’t distinguish between the types of the number 5 and the string '5'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex 4\n",
    "If you’re debugging a program with print, these type differences matter. What you\n",
    "almost always want while debugging is to see the repr version of an object. The repr\n",
    "built-in function returns the printable representation of an object, which should be its most\n",
    "clearly understandable string representation. For built-in types, the string returned by\n",
    "repr is a valid Python expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex 5\n",
    "Passing the value from repr to the eval built-in function should result in the same\n",
    "Python object you started with (of course, in practice, you should only use eval with\n",
    "extreme caution).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex 6\n",
    "When you’re debugging with print, you should repr the value before printing to\n",
    "ensure that any difference in types is clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex 7\n",
    "This is equivalent to using the '%r' format string and the % operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex 8\n",
    "For dynamic Python objects, the default human-readable string value is the same as the\n",
    "repr value. This means that passing a dynamic object to print will do the right thing,\n",
    "and you don’t need to explicitly call repr on it. Unfortunately, the default value of repr\n",
    "for object instances isn’t especially helpful. For example, here I define a simple class\n",
    "and then print its value:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex 9\n",
    "This output can’t be passed to the eval function, and it says nothing about the instance\n",
    "fields of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two solutions to this problem. If you have control of the class, you can define\n",
    "your own __repr__ special method that returns a string containing the Python\n",
    "expression that recreates the object. Here, I define that function for the class above:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex 10\n",
    "Now, the repr value is much more useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex 11\n",
    "When you don’t have control over the class definition, you can reach into the object’s\n",
    "instance dictionary, which is stored in the __dict__ attribute. Here, I print out the\n",
