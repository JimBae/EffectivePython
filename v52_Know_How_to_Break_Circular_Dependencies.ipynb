    "dialog module toward the bottom of the app module, after its contents have run, the\n",
    "AttributeError goes away.\n",

    "## Import, Configure, Run\n",
    "\n",
    "A second solution to the circular imports problem is to have your modules minimize side\n",
    "effects at import time. You have your modules only define functions, classes, and\n",
    "constants. You avoid actually running any functions at import time. Then, you have each\n",
    "module provide a configure function that you call once all other modules have\n",

    "## Dynamic Import\n",
    "The third—and often simplest—solution to the circular imports problem is to use an\n",
    "import statement within a function or method. This is called a dynamic import because\n",
    "the module import happens while the program is running, not while the program is first\n",
    "starting up and initializing its modules.\n",

    "Here, I redefine the dialog module to use a dynamic import. The dialog.show\n",
    "function imports the app module at runtime instead of the dialog module importing\n",
    "app at initialization time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has a similar effect to the import, configure, and run steps from before. The\n",
    "difference is that this requires no structural changes to the way the modules are defined\n",
    "and imported. You’re simply delaying the circular import until the moment you must\n",
    "access the other module. At that point, you can be pretty sure that all other modules have\n",
    "already been initialized (step #5 is complete for everything).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it’s good to avoid dynamic imports like this. The cost of the import statement\n",
    "is not negligible and can be especially bad in tight loops. By delaying execution, dynamic\n",
    "imports also set you up for surprising failures at runtime, such as SyntaxError\n",
    "exceptions long after your program has started running (see Item 56: “Test Everything\n",
    "with unittest” for how to avoid that). However, these downsides are often better than\n",
    "the alternative of restructuring your entire program."
