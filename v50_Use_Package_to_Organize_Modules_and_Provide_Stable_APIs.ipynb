    "\n",
    "The first use of packages is to help divide your modules into separate namespaces. This\n",
    "allows you to have many modules with the same filename but different absolute paths that\n",
    "are unique. For example, here’s a program that imports attributes from two modules with\n",

    "attributes directly won’t work because the second import statement will overwrite the\n",

    "The as clause can be used to rename anything you retrieve with the import statement,\n",
    "including entire modules. This makes it easy to access namespaced code and make its\n",

    "\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "Another approach for avoiding imported name conflicts is to always access names\n",
    "by their highest unique module name.\n",
    "For the example above, you’d first import analysis.utils and import\n",
    "frontend.utils. Then, you’d access the inspect functions with the full\n",
    "paths of analysis.utils.inspect and frontend.utils.inspect.\n",
    "This approach allows you to avoid the as clause altogether. It also makes it\n",

    "## Stable APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "The second use of packages in Python is to provide strict, stable APIs for external\n",
    "consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re writing an API for wider consumption, like an open source package (see\n",
    "Item 48: “Know Where to Find Community-Built Modules”), you’ll want to provide\n",
    "stable functionality that doesn’t change between releases. To ensure that happens, it’s\n",
    "important to hide your internal code organization from external users. This enables you to\n",
    "refactor and improve your package’s internal modules without breaking existing users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can limit the surface area exposed to API consumers by using the __all__\n",
    "special attribute of a module or package. The value of __all__ is a list of every name to\n",
    "export from the module as part of its public API. When consuming code does from foo\n",
    "import *, only the attributes in foo.__all__ will be imported from foo. If\n",
    "__all__ isn’t present in foo, then only public attributes, those without a leading\n",
    "underscore, are imported (see Item 27: “Prefer Public Attributes Over Private Ones”).\n",
    "For example, say you want to provide a package for calculating collisions between\n",
    "moving projectiles. Here, I define the models module of mypackage to contain the\n",
    "representation of projectiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "I also define a utils module in mypackage to perform operations on the\n",
    "Projectile instances, such as simulating collisions between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I’d like to provide all of the public parts of this API as a set of attributes that are\n",
    "available on the mypackage module. This will allow downstream consumers to always\n",
    "import directly from mypackage instead of importing from mypackage.models or\n",
    "mypackage.utils. This ensures that the API consumer’s code will continue to work\n",
    "even if the internal organization of mypackage changes (e.g., models.py is deleted).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this with Python packages, you need to modify the __init__.py file in the\n",
    "mypackage directory. This file actually becomes the contents of the mypackage\n",
    "module when it’s imported. Thus, you can specify an explicit API for mypackage by\n",
    "limiting what you import into __init__.py. Since all of my internal modules already\n",
    "specify __all__, I can expose the public interface of mypackage by simply importing\n",
    "everything from the internal modules and updating __all__ accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, internal-only functions like mypackage.utils._dot_product will not be\n",
    "available to the API consumer on mypackage because they weren’t present in\n",
    "__all__. Being omitted from __all__ means they weren’t imported by the from\n",
    "mypackage import * statement. The internal-only names are effectively hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "This whole approach works great when it’s important to provide an explicit, stable API.\n",
    "However, if you’re building an API for use between your own modules, the functionality\n",
    "of __all__ is probably unnecessary and should be avoided. The namespacing provided\n",
    "by packages is usually enough for a team of programmers to collaborate on large amounts\n",
    "of code they control while maintaining reasonable interface boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "### Beware of import *\n",
    "Import statements like from x import y are clear because the source of y is\n",
    "explicitly the x package or module. Wildcard imports like from foo import *\n",
    "can also be useful, especially in interactive Python sessions. However, wildcards\n",
    "make code more difficult to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    " - from foo import * hides the source of names from new readers of the code. If a module has multiple import * statements, you’ll need to check all of the referenced modules to figure out where a name was defined.\n",
    " - Names from import * statements will overwrite any conflicting names within the containing module. This can lead to strange bugs caused by accidental interactions between your code and overlapping names from multiple import * statements. \n",
