    "the ones that you didn’t intend to raise. These are bugs in your API’s code.\n",
    "Using the try/except statement above will not insulate API consumers from bugs in\n",
    "your API module’s code. To do that, the caller needs to add another except block that\n",

    "there’s a bug in the API module’s implementation that needs to be fixed.\n",
    "\n",
