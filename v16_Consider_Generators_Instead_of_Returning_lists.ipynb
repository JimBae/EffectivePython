    "1.\n",

    "I call the append method. The method call’s bulk (result.append) deemphasizes the\n",
    "value being added to the list (index + 1). There is one line for creating the result list\n",
    "and another for returning it. While the function body contains ~130 characters (without\n",
    "whitespace), only ~75 characters are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better way to write this function is using a generator. Generators are functions that use\n",
    "yield expressions. When called, generator functions do not actually run but instead\n",
    "immediately return an iterator. With each call to the next built-in function, the iterator\n",
    "will advance the generator to its next yield expression. Each value passed to yield by\n",
    "the generator will be returned by the iterator to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s significantly easier to read because all interactions with the result list have been\n",
    "eliminated. Results are passed to yield expressions instead. The iterator returned by the\n",
    "generator call can easily be converted to a list by passing it to the list built-in function\n",
    "(see Item 9: “Consider Generator Expressions for Large Comprehensions” for how this\n",
    "works).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\n",
    "The second problem with index_words is that it requires all results to be stored in the\n",
    "list before being returned. For huge inputs, this can cause your program to run out of\n",
    "memory and crash. In contrast, a generator version of this function can easily be adapted\n",
