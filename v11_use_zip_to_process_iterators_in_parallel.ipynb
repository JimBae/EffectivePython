    "There are two problems with the zip built-in.\n",
    "1. The first issue is that in Python 2 zip is not a generator; it will fully exhaust the supplied iterators and return a list of all the tuples it creates. This could potentially use a lot of memory and cause your program to crash. If you want to zip very large iterators in Python 2, you should use izip from the itertools built-in module (see Item 46: “Use Built-in Algorithms and Data Structures”).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. zip behaves strangely if the input iterators are of different lengths. For example, say you add another name to the list above but forget to update the letter counts. Running zip on the two input lists will have an unexpected result.\n"
