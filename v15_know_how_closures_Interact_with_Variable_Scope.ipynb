    "1. Python supports closures: functions that refer to variables from the scope in which they were defined. This is why the helper function is able to access the group argument to  sort_priority.\n",

    "3. Python has specific rules for comparing tuples. It first compares items in index zero, then index one, then index two, and so on. This is why the return value from the helper closure causes the sort order to have two distinct groups.\n",
